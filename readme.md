# Todo-list-application
Essential typescript's todolist application

## Essential Typescript
An instructional typescript book that I'm working through. The first chapter had you develop through stages a todo list application. It took me a while to get through it and I actually started and stopped this book a few times before deleting everything and doing everything over and then finishing it.

## Why github
I'm adding this to github as a method of documenting what I've done and because I need more practice creating repos and pushing files etc.

## Obviously its not my code
I'm not that good of a coder yet and am learning typescript with the purpose of advancing my technical skills in QA. Eventually I'd like to get into automation testing and javascript and typescript are pretty important
skills to do that well. Hence why I am here. I feel its important to document what is my code and whats
something I've copied from a tutorial book what have you.
